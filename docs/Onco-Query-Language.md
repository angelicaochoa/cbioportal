# Advanced cancer genomic data visualization: Onco Query Language (OQL)

You can use the Onco Query Language (OQL) to select and define genetic alterations on the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. OQL-specified genetic alterations will be reflected on most tabs, including OncoPrint, but are not currently reflected on the Plots or Mutations tabs. Note the OQL assumes any word that it doesn't recognize is a mutation code.
